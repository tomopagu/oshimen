# Oshimen

## An easy way to showcase the idols you support

Oshimen is a simple webapp to showcase the idols you support, you basically make an account and then favourite idols which'll then be displayed on your user page which can be shared with everyone. So the next time someone asks your oshimen, you can link them to your oshimen page.

### Install

You'll need to be able to run Laravel with a MySQL database at least to get the site working locally. If you'd like to make Style/Javascript changes then you'll need nodeJS & gulp to compile the assets in `resources/assets/`.

### Contributing

If you have any suggestions for the site or if it breaks please let me know on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tomopagu) or make an issue on here.
